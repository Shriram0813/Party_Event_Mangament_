       <div className='key'><h2>Key Features</h2></div> 
        <p>
        * Outdoor Elegance: A garden party is characterized by its outdoor setting, often held in a well-maintained garden or outdoor space. The key feature is the natural ambiance, with guests enjoying the beauty of the surroundings, including flowers, greenery, and open skies.
        </p>
       <div className='para'> <p>
       * Relaxed Atmosphere: Unlike more formal events, garden parties typically have a casual and relaxed atmosphere. Guests are encouraged to mingle, enjoy outdoor activities, and savor refreshments in a laid-back setting. This creates a friendly and enjoyable environment for socializing.
        </p></div>
        <div className='para'> <p>
        * Seasonal Decor and Cuisine: Garden parties often incorporate seasonal elements in both decor and cuisine. Whether it's spring, summer, fall, or winter, the theme and decorations can reflect the current season. Additionally, the menu may highlight fresh, seasonal ingredients, and drinks may include refreshing options suitable for the outdoor setting.
